# Group Configuration Template
# Place this file as `group_config.yaml` in group folders (e.g., agents/group_슈타게/group_config.yaml)
# to override tool configurations from tools.yaml for all agents in this group.
#
# This follows the same structure as backend/config/tools/tools.yaml
# Any fields specified here will override the global defaults for this group's agents.

# Enable interrupt_every_turn for all agents in this group
# When true, agents in this group will always get a turn immediately after any response
# Example conversation flow with interrupt_every_turn: true
#   User: "Hello"
#   Agent A: "Hi there!"
#   [Interrupt agent responds immediately]
#   Narrator: "Agent A greeted the user"
#   Agent B: "Hey!"
#   [Interrupt agent responds again]
#   Narrator: "Agent B also greeted"
# interrupt_every_turn: false  # Default: false

# Set priority for all agents in this group
# Higher priority agents respond first (both in initial and follow-up rounds)
# Priority values: 0 (normal/default), 1-10 (higher = more priority)
# Example: priority: 5 makes this group's agents respond before priority: 3 agents
# Note: Replaces deprecated PRIORITY_AGENTS environment variable
# priority: 0  # Default: 0 (normal priority)

# Example: Override recall tool to return memories verbatim without AI rephrasing
# tools:
#   recall:
#     response: "{memory_content}"  # Just return raw content, no wrapper text
#
# Example: Add custom prefix/suffix to recalled memories
# tools:
#   recall:
#     response: "**기억을 떠올렸다:**\n{memory_content}"
#
# Example: Override skip tool response
# tools:
#   skip:
#     response: "Group-specific skip message for this group."
#
# Example: Override memorize tool description
# tools:
#   memorize:
#     description: "Custom description for this group's memorize behavior"

tools: {}  # Add your tool overrides here
