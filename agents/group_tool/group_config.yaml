# Group Configuration for group_tool
# This group demonstrates the interrupt_every_turn feature

# Enable interrupt_every_turn for all agents in this group
# When enabled, agents will always get a turn immediately after any response
# Example: If agent A says "hello", this group's agents will respond next before other agents
interrupt_every_turn: true
priority: 5

# Set priority for this group's agents (optional)
# Higher values = higher priority (agents respond before lower priority agents)
# Default: 0 (normal priority)
# priority: 5

# Make this group's agents "transparent" in turn-taking
# When enabled, other agents won't be triggered to respond after this agent speaks
# But other agents CAN still see/read this agent's messages in conversation history
# Useful for Narrator-type agents whose commentary shouldn't prompt replies
transparent: true
